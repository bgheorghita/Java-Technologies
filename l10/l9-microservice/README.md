# Java Technologies - Lab 10

- The application exposes a CRUD REST resource as a microservice
- Used Fallback + Timeout and Retry, CircuitBreaker, Bulkhead thread-pool, and semaphore for resilient microservices
- Implemented a health check procedure, in order to determine the readiness and the liveness of the service
- Used MicroProfile Metrics API in order to monitor the behaviour of the service
- Created a Docker container for the microservice
